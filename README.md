# Minesweeper
We created Minesweeper as one of my AET Labs. I added in graphics as an extension.

DriverMinesweeper.java and Minesweeper were both AET class labs. In class, we simply made the logic and printed the Minesweepers to the Consol. 
I myself, outside of class added in the graphics.

# Reflections
The logic we did in class (DriverMinesweeper.java and Minesweeper) was interesting, the hardest part with that was to count the surrounding mines. However, that was pretty easy. 
I did Graphics alone and honestly, it helped me realize how weak I was in Graphics. A few things I want to improve on for next time is to reduce the lag in the images. The lag arises from the fact that ever few milliseconds I load in images. For next time, I will load in all the image assets first, rather than constantly loading them in.
